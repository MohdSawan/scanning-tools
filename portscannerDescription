This Python script is a basic port scanner that allows users to scan a specified number of ports on one or multiple target IP addresses.

Imports: Uses socket for network communication and termcolor for colored terminal text.
Functions:
scan(target, ports): Scans the specified number of ports on the given target IP address.
scan_port(ipaddress, port): Checks if a specific port on the given IP address is open.
User Input: Prompts the user to enter target IP addresses (comma-separated for multiple targets) and the number of ports to scan.
Scanning Logic: Determines if multiple targets are entered, splits them accordingly, and scans each target for the specified number of ports. It prints open ports in green text.
Usage:
Run the script and provide the target IP addresses and the number of ports to scan.
The script will check each port from 1 up to the specified number and indicate which ports are open.
This tool helps in network troubleshooting and security auditing by identifying open ports on specified IP addresses.
